# VI-Simplified (vis) Java Implementation (visj)

This is the Java implementation of VIS (visj).

VIS is a VI like editor with many capabilities over and above VI but is much simpler than VIM.
VIS was designed to have a command set that is mostly but not fully backwardly compatible with VIM.
VIS does not use the control key for editing, and is therefore much easier to use on small keyboards.
VIS has a simpler command set as compared to VIM and is therefore easier to learn and more productive.
VIS was designed to work correctly out of the box and therefore does not need configuration files.

Here are some of the major features of VIS:

* Enhanced capabilities over VI
* Simpler and easier to use than VIM
* Does not use the control key for editing, so works better on small keyboards
* Works correctly out of the box and does not use configuration files
* Has a simplified command set than VIM and is therefore easier to learn
* Has built in buffer editor and has strong support for multiple files
* Has split buffers
* Has built in file directory browser
* Has visual modes
* Has a buffer to run shell commands
* Has built in support for diffing files
* Has undo since last save
